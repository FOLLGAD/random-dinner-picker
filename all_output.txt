I understand that you want to create a program that takes the names of your friends and the cost of their dinner as input, and then randomly selects a person to pay for the dinner, with the probability of being selected weighted by the cost of their dinner. I will create a Python program for this purpose.

Here's the plan for the architecture:

1. Create a `Person` class to store the name and cost of dinner for each person.
2. Create a `Dinner` class to store a list of `Person` objects and handle the random selection of a person to pay for the dinner.
3. Create a main function to handle user input and display the result.

Now, let's create the necessary files and implement the code.

person.py
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    dinner_cost: float
```

dinner.py
```python
import random
from typing import List
from person import Person

class Dinner:
    def __init__(self, people: List[Person]):
        self.people = people

    def weighted_random_choice(self) -> Person:
        """
        Select a person randomly, with the probability of being selected
        weighted by the cost of their dinner.
        """
        total_cost = sum(person.dinner_cost for person in self.people)
        random_choice = random.uniform(0, total_cost)
        current_sum = 0
        for person in self.people:
            current_sum += person.dinner_cost
            if random_choice <= current_sum:
                return person
```

main.py
```python
from person import Person
from dinner import Dinner

def main():
    people = []
    while True:
        name = input("Enter a name (or 'done' to finish): ")
        if name.lower() == 'done':
            break
        cost = float(input(f"Enter the cost of {name}'s dinner: "))
        people.append(Person(name, cost))

    dinner = Dinner(people)
    payer = dinner.weighted_random_choice()
    print(f"{payer.name} should pay for the dinner.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

requirements.txt
```
```

To run the program, simply execute the `main.py` file:

```
python main.py
```

This will prompt you to enter the names and dinner costs for each person, and then it will randomly select a person to pay for the dinner based on the weighted costs.
